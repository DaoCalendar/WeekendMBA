**Opening thoughts**:

I absolutely love Jim Rohn’s work so I was excited to finally buy the audiobook and take it off my wishlist. I know that Jim is most recognized for being the guy who inspired Tony Robbins, as well as becoming an internationally-known speaker. I also believe that he built his career as a salesman which is why a lot of his works revolve around personal development. Not only that, but I enjoy listening to the classics like with Zig Ziglar, whose work inspired the past generation of self-development gurus.

**Key notes**:

*   Don’t be a follower, be a student
*   Make sure what you do is the product of your own conclusion
*   Fundamentals are the important building blocks for success, the basics
*   There are no new fundamentals. All the fundamentals are old and established
*   **Happiness** is a joy that most often comes as a result of _positive activity_
    *   It is both the _joy of discovery_ and the _joy of knowing_. It is a result of the awareness of a full range of life. It is the joy that comes from designing a life and practicing the fine art of living well
*   **Discipline. **Itis the bridge between _thought_ and _accomplishment_. The bridge between _inspiration_ and value _achievement._ The bridge between the _necessity_ and _productivity_
*   Whether or not you start and whether or not you continue are all that are important

*   Learn from your own life
    *   _Make your own life one of your most important studies_
    *   Be sure to study the negative as well as the positive. Our failures serve us well when they teach us valuable lessons
*   _One of the ways we learn_ how to do something right is simply by doing it wrongThe next place to learn is from other people’s experiences, whether they’ve done it right or wrong
*   **_All leaders are readers_**. Like most successful people have in common is that they’re constantly reading and learning and have an endless curiosityStart a library
    *   Don’t just read easy stuff. You won’t grow, change, or develop
    *   The Bible is a great book because it has both examples and warnings through its stories
    *   Be a good student by keeping a _separate journal_ and writing all your notes down from books.
*   A journal is one of the best things to leave behind when you’re gone

    *   Everyone has to get good at one of two things: planting in the spring, or begging in the fall
    *   Learn how to nourish and protect your crops all summer. Prevent the intruder from taking the goods, a major skill to learn
    *   Two key phrases: 1) all good will be attacked. 2) all values must be defended
    *   Learn how to reap in the fall without complaint
*   **_Take full responsibility for what happens to you_**. It is the highest form of human maturity
    *   **_Success_** is not something you pursue, it is something you become

*   Get excited about your ability to do the necessary things. **Discipline.**
*   Important rule: **Take care of yourself. **Some people _don’t do well_ because _they don’t feel well_
    *   Make sure the outside is a major reflection of what’s going on inside
*   If you do believe in spirituality, study it and practice it regularly
*   The Five Abilities to develop:
    1.  **The ability to absorb**. Not only the words and knowledge, but the atmosphere, experience, and what’s going on
        *   Don’t just get _through_ the day, get _from_ it. Learn from it and let it teach you. Learn from the University of Life
    2.  **Learn to respond**. Let life touch you, both sad things, happy things, and everything in between
        *   Give into the emotion and let it strike you. Our emotions need to be educated as well as our intellect. It’s important to know _how to feel and respond_
    3.  **Learn the ability to reflect.**Take a half-day at the end of each month to reflect. Take a weekend at the end of every year to reflect. Take a few hours to reflect at the end of the week
        *   Learning to gather up the past and invest it in the future
            *   _Self-sacrifice_ is not noble, but _self-development_ is. Think about how much you can give back when you develop yourself and not sacrifice yourself, which only produces contempt
    4.  **Develop the ability to act.**Set up the discipline when the _intent_ and _motivation_ and _inspiration_ is high
        *   Every letdown affects the rest of your performance. Every new discipline affects the rest
        *   Make rest a necessity, not an objective
    5.  **Develop the ability to share.** If you learn a good idea today, pass it along
        *   Pouring and giving out what you know to others expand your own capacity so that you can hold more of the next experience
        *   To be the greatest and most powerful is a worthy ambition as long as it’s done at the service of many
        *   **_Service to many leads to great wealth, recognition, satisfaction_**
        *   “_If you help enough people get what they want, you can have everything you want_” -Zig Ziglar
*   **Financial independence** is the ability to live from the income of your own personal resources
    *   _The Richest Man in Babylon_. The theme is _what you do with what you have_ is more important than _what you have_
    *   What you do with your money says a lot about you
    *   Don’t think if you had more money you would have a better plan
        *   In reality, **_if you had a better plan, you would have more money_**
        *   It’s not the amount that counts, it’s the plan that counts. It’s not what you allocate, it’s how you allocate it
    *   Spend 70% of your net. Use _10% on charity_, _10% on engaging in the marketplace_ with buying, fixing, selling and some sort of hobby. Use _10% on investing_ in the marketplace
    *   Keep strict financial accounts so you know where it all goes
    *   It’s not the amount that counts, it’s what it represents of your life that counts
*   Ask yourself: _who am I around_ and what are they doing to me in terms of influence?
    *   All you need to do is get around a person with a better plan and adopt it for anything, whether it be health or finances or something else
    *   Pity the man who has a favorite restaurant but not a favorite thinker
    *   _We all need associations with people of substance to provide influence concerning major issues_
*   **_Strive to become the kind of person that people of quality and substance would want to be associated with_**
    *   Become a person of skillful language, positive attitude, well read and well disciplined. A person of culture and intelligence
*   We are all affected by 5 factors:
    1.  environment
    2.  events
    3.  knowledge
    4.  results
    5.  view of the future
*   Of all the five influences, make sure _your dreams are the greatest influence_ on your daily decisions and activities
    *   **_Make sure the greatest pull on you is the pull of the future_**
*   Well defined goals are like a magnet. The harder you work on them, the stronger the pull
    *   Regardless of talent, if you had enough reasons, you can accomplish anything
    *   Ask yourself: what has you turned off?
*   His mentor said to set a goal to become a millionaire for _what it will make of you to achieve itSet a goal that will make you stretch that far. It’s not the goal itself, it’s what it will make of you to achieve it_
    *   **_The greatest value in life is not what you get, the greatest value is what you become_**
    *   Don’t set your goals to low. Don’t join an easy crowd, you won’t grow. Go where the expectations are high
        *   Go where the demands are high. Go where the pressure is on to perform
*   Key idea: the _greatest source of unhappiness_ is self-unhappiness. The greatest source of unhappiness comes from inside, not outside
*   Goal setting questions:
    *   What do I want in the next 1 to 10 years? Make a list of 50 things you want
        *   Write a number next to the goal corresponding to how many years it will take to achieve it
    *   _The way you enjoy life best is when you wrap up one goal, you immediately start on the next one_
*   Include three types of goals:
    1.  Financial and economic (income, profits, productivity)
    2.  Material (tangibles like a home, car, boat, jewelry, etc.)
    3.  Personal development goals (physical, lose weight, be more decisive, perfect and leader and communicator, learn another language, etc.)
*   Next step: pick out the four most important 1-year goals, four most important 3-year goals, four important 5-year goals, four important 10-year goals
    *   Describe in detail each one of these 16 goals on paper. Describe why each goal is important to either talk yourself into or talk yourself out of it
*   Set aside time every week to review, reevaluate, at two, and edit your goals
*   Short-range goals, achievable in one year, are called **confidence builders**
*   **_It is very important to celebrate progress._** Celebrate when you check off a short range or long-range goal
*   We grow from two experiences: the joy of winning and the pain of losingGoals should be _fun_, _big, challenging, rewarding, allow you to grow_
*   Ask: what kind of person do I have to become to get all I want to?
    *   This will help you write out personal development goal
*   **_Don’t just learn how to earn, learn how to live_**. This is what lifestyle is all about.
    *   One of the great challenges of life: being happy with what you have while in pursuit of what you want
*   Key idea: **_More money will only make you more of what you already are_**. The key to happiness is not more
    *   _Happiness is an art_ to be studied and practiced. More money will only more quickly send you to your destination
*   If we don’t go for the higher tastes, we will settle for the lower ones
    *   **_Develop an appreciation for the fine_**, develop an appetite for the unique things in life. Study the art and reach for the best
*   Sophisticated people ensure a good service by giving the tip upfront. This is how tips originally were intended
*   The **good life** is not an amount. It is an _attitude_, an _act_, an _idea_, a _discovery_, a _search_.
    *   It comes from a lifestyle that is fully developed regardless of bank account so that it provides you with a constant sense of joy and living, and fuels the fires of commitment to all of the disciplines and fundamentals that make life worthwhile
*   _The negative is not to be ignored, it is to be mastered_. You’ve got to learn to do battle with the enemies on the outside and the inside
*   Advice: **_Welcome all experiences. You never know which one is gonna turn everything on_**
*   Resolve says, “_I will_.” Two of the most powerful words in the language.
    *   **Resolve** means promising yourself you will never give up
*   Advice: **_Learn to help people with their lives_**, not just their jobs
    *   Help them with their goals and dreams, their future, with errors and mistakes
*   If you work on your gifts, they will make room for you
*   Questions to ponder:
    *   Why do something?
    *   Why not?
    *   Why not you?

**Closing thoughts**:

This book is very foundational to personal development as it follows a very familiar structure. It started with attitude and psychology, then it worked up to continuous learning and increasing your value. It then finished it off with happiness, giving, and helping others. Also, Jim Rohn’s speaking and tone is super entertaining and such a blast from the past.

There are a lot of repeating principles and lessons in this book as he jumps back-and-forth between recorded studio segments and live segments. It’s good that it reiterates and drives the point home, but at times it can feel a bit repetitive and superfluous.

I love the quote “_you’ve got to do battle with the enemy on the inside and outside_.” This reminds me of the saying “_Life is a fight or territory. When you don’t fight for what you want, what you don’t want will come in_.” If we aren’t proactive with creating the ideal life that we want, we will end up being reactive in trying to fend off the things we don’t want.

What I really liked about this audiobook is that while the items he discusses are very foundational and principle-based, he has a lot of great action items and next steps. Also, listening to him is very motivating and makes me want to take action, especially the live seminar segments. While some books have great stories and are inspiring, I left this one feeling really galvanized to action to work on my goals. I actually revisited my master goals list and made a few new commitments once I finished this audiobook.

Overall, Jim Rohn provides extreme value with his timeless knowledge that’s extremely applicable no matter when you listen to it, who you are, and what your goals are. Would highly recommend for anybody who needs a kick in the butt to get “started on their dreams” as Jim would say. Perfect listen for the beginning of the new year.
