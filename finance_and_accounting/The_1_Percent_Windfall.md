Critical pricing decisions are often made using arbitary “this is the way we’ve always done it” methods.

*   Instead of a driver of new profits, prices are a mix of marking up costs, maintaining margins, matching competitors and seat-of-the-pants analyses.
*   A small change in price can have a big effect on a company’s financial bottom line.

## The Foundation of Pricing: Value-Based Pricing

*   A price that is based on cost bears no relation to what customers might pay. Instead, capture value by thinking like your customers.

**Methodology #1: One-on-one pricing**

**Step 1:** Identify target customers. E.g vacationers looking to rent a beach house for a week.

**Step 2:** Identify their next-best alternative. The beach house next door. Use this product’s price as a starting point.

**Step 3:** Determine your product’s difference. Your house has a pool.

**Step 4:** Calculate your product’s value based on its differentiation. Suppose you’ve determined that the average vacationer will pay a 20% premium over their next-best alternative for a pool.

**Step 5:** Do a reality check. Before basing your price on your customer’s next-best alternative, you have to undertake 2 analyses. First, determine if the base price is realistic. If the price of the next-best alternative is too high, it’s not a valid price to use as a starting point. Second, ask yourself, “can I make money at this price? Does the price at least cover variable costs?”

*   Consumer insights on value can be gleaned through 2 methods — 1) experienced judgement or 2) market research. Companies often rely on experienced judgment supported by insights from existing market research.

Key characteristics that differentiate a product:

*   Brand — a pledge of satisfaction and quality.
*   Quality — a higher degree of excellence than the norm
*   Attributes — physical characteristics of a product
*   Service — ancillary nonphysical characteristics of a product
*   Ease of purchase — level of convenience involved in locating and purchasing a product
*   Style — the distinctive artistic expression of a product

**Methodology #2: Multi-customer**

1.  Identify next-best alternative and use as base price (reality-check base price)
2.  Determine product’s differences
3.  Create a demand curve
4.  Undertake a profit maximizer analysis

**Profit Maximizer Analysis**

*   Involves first determining revenues, costs and profits at different price levels. After these data are available, the next step is to select the price associated with the highest profits.

**Demand Curve**

*   Created using market research (conjoint analysis), experienced judgment or one-on-one pricing methodology

**6 Core Forces that can change a product’s value**

1.  Consumer budget — reduced income leads to lower willingness to pay for premium attributes
2.  Next-best alternatives — new competitors enter the market / existing competitors change their attributes or price
3.  Close and extended substitutes for consumers
4.  Consumer taste/trends — shift in consumer’s preferences
5.  New attributes
6.  Complementary products

The epiphany to better pricing is to understand and embrace the idea that a wide variety of customers are interested in buying your product, and these customers differ from each other, and then making efforts to profit from these differences.

**3 types:**

*   Customers desire a different pricing plan — pick-a-plan strategy
*   Customers have unique product needs — versioning strategy
*   Customers value a product differently — differential pricing strategy

## Pick-a-plan

A barrier to purchase is that potential customers may not like the current pricing plan. These customers can be drawn in with a new pricing option.

**Ownership Alternatives**

Some customers are interested in a particular product but can’t afford / don’t need to own it.

1.  Interval Ownership

*   “I don’t need to own the whole product, but I am interested in owning part of it.”
*   concept of parsing a whole product into smaller ownership units and selling these incremental units individually.

2\. Leasing

*   “I don’t want to own your product, but I am interested in contracting to use it for an extended time period.”
*   Involves purchasing the right to use a product for a fixed period
*   Lease payments are based on how much a product depreciates over the lease term.
*   The higher the depreciation rate, the greater the lease payment.

3\. Rental

*   “I’d like to use your product for a short period of time.”
*   allows customers to use a product for a period shorter than leases typically offer.

4\. Netflix Model

*   “I am interested in renting your products, and I value variety.”
*   type of rental that involves paying a fixed monthly price for a set number of products with exchange privileges.

**Uncertain Value**

Sometimes it’s difficult for consumers to estimate the ultimate value of a product.

5\. Success Fees

*   “I’m interested in your product but am concerned about its performance.”
*   used in pricing scenarios that involve uncertainty or are highly dependent on the future efforts of one party.
*   Involves a base price plus a bonus if key success metric is achieved.

6\. Licensing

*   “I love your product, but I’m unsure about its long-term commercial value.”
*   strategy of allowing third parties to use intellectual property (trademarks, patents, or technology) in return for financial compensation tied to its value.

7\. Auctions

*   “I’m interested in purchasing, but your product’s value is too uncertain.”
*   involves accepting bids for a product and selling to the highest bidder at the end of a fixed period

8\. Future Purchase Options

*   “I’m not sure if I’ll use your product in the future. However, I am willing to pay a fee today to lock in a price for tomorrow if I need it.”
*   offer consumers the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a product in the future.

**Price Certainty**

Reducing or eliminating price uncertainty appeals to customers and provide a competitive edge.

9\. Flat Rate

*   “I don’t appreciate the anxiety of watching the hours for my project rack up; I prefer a set price.”
*   offers to undertake a project for a fixed fee.

10\. Peace of Mind Guarantee

*   “For psychological and planning purposes, I value locking in product prices for the future.”
*   option of protecting consumers for price fluctuations by offering a fixed price for a given time period.

11\. All-You-Can-Eat

*   “I’d like to use and/or sample as much as I want without having to consider every purchase.”
*   involves paying one price for the freedom to enjoy all that you can eat or use.
*   these plans are profitable only if these profit drainers are balanced by low-volume customers who pay a premium for not having to think about every transaction as they consume.

12\. Two-Part High/Low Pricing

*   “To receive everyday low prices, I am willing to pay an up-front fee.”
*   involves charging an upfront price and then setting low second-part variable prices

**Financing and other constraints**

Customers are able to pay and are fine with the price, but just need help overcoming their obstacles.

13\. Financing

*   “I love your product but need help structuring payments to meet my budget.”
*   the option of allowing customers to spread out their payments over time with an annual financing rate that can be as low as 0%

14\. Job Loss Protection

*   “I’m interested in your product but am hesitant to purchase because I am concerned that I may be laid off in the future.”
*   involves sellers canceling a purchase or making monthly payments in the event the buyer gets laid off.

15\. Layaway

*   “With credit being tight, I am looking for an alternative to financing my purchases.”
*   the practice of a retailer putting aside desired items and having customers pay over time. Only after the full price is paid can the product leave the store.

16\. Prepaid Plans

*   “My credit is poor and I’m not eligible for a monthly billing plan.” / “Pricing plans require me to have services I don’t need or that don’t fit my usage patterns.”
*   customers pay in advance for a product and then let them draw down this credit with usage.

## Versioning

Involves using a core product as a base and adding/subtracting attributes in a manner that serves more customers. Versioning can be thought of as offering a line of good, better, best products.

**Premium Versions**

Involves adding superior attributes to a product.

1.  High Quality

*   “I want, and am willing to pay for, the best.”
*   involves enhancing a product’s value with new attributes
*   can profit from devoted customers who want and are willing to pay for more.

2\. Guaranteed Access

*   “I want a guarantee that I’ll be able to buy your service or product.”
*   ensures that a product/service is available when needed

3\. Priority Access

*   “I am willing to pay more to go to the head of the line.”
*   charging more to bypass waiting for a product/service

4\. Faster Product

*   “I value speed”
*   captures the value customers place on saving time

5\. Low Deductibles and Better Coverage

*   “I prefer an insurance policy with low deductibles and comprehensive coverage”
*   consumers concerned with risk

**Stripped-Down Versions**

Involves trimming a product’s attributes and reducing its price.

6\. Lower Quality

*   “I’m interested in your product; do you have a discounted version with fewer features?”
*   involves reducing the number of attributes to decrease the price

7\. More Restrictions

*   “I am willing to accept more restrictions for a discount.”

8\. Unbundling

*   “I’m only interested in buying a part of your product.”
*   the practice of allowing customers to purchase parts of a product instead of the whole.

9\. Off-Peak Pricing

*   “For a discount, I’d purchase during off-peak times.”
*   involves setting discount prices to attract more customers during periods of low demand.

10\. Private Label

*   a manufacturer sells its product (or a lower-quality version) not with its brand name on the label but under a retailer’s name

11\. High Deductibles and Lower Benefits

*   “Can you offer me a lower price in return for lower insurance benefits?”

**Unique Customer Needs**

12\. Package Size

*   “I’d value a different-size package of your product.”
*   involves offering different package sizes to meet customers’ needs

13\. Extended and Enhanced Warranties

*   “A premium warranty is important to me when purchasing products.”

14\. Monthly Clubs

*   “I’m interested in receiving a new product every month.”

15\. Bundling

*   pricing strategy of offering multiple products together to meet a specific customer need

16\. Platforms

*   offering the same basic product on different platforms (e.g book content is sold in print, digital, audio and sometimes video.)

17\. Usage Purposes

*   involves modifying a product so it can be used for a new reason

## Differential Pricing

Offering a range of prices for the same product can lead to increased sales and profits by targeting unique customers. Differential pricing is a strategy that reaps higher margins from some customers, attracts price-sensitive customers with discounts and helps businesses market their products.

**Hurdles**

Creating hurdles requires price-sensitive customers to proactively demonstrate they want a lower price.

1.  Rebates

*   “I am willing to fill out forms, mail them and wait several weeks to get a lower price.”

2\. Sales

*   “If you put it on sale, I’ll buy.”

3\. Coupons

*   “I am willing to be on the lookout for, cut out, organize, carry and then redeem coupons at a store in return for a discount.”

4\. Price Match Guarantee

*   “Will you match the discount price that is offered by a rival?”

5\. Distribution

*   “I am willing to trade convenience for a discount.”

6\. Time in Sales Cycle

*   “I’ll wait for a lower price.”
*   Prices start off high and are lowered over time to open up the market to new customers.

**Customer Characteristics**

Customer characteristics can reflect their valuation of a product, and thus the price he/she is willing to pay, e.g senior citizens are presumed to be price-sensitive.

7\. Geographic Location

*   prices differ by geographic location

8\. Readily Verifiable Traits

*   age, status, locals vs out-of-towners

9\. Club Affiliation

*   in exchange for being featured in marketing materials, companies offer discounts to customers affiliated with a club.

10\. Customer History

*   customer history can reveal their valuation of product, e.g insurance companies use customer’s past claims to determine insurance premium

**Selling Characteristics**

11\. Quantity

*   “Since I’m buying a large amount of your product, will you give me a discount?”

12\. Mixed Bundling

*   involves selling products both individually as well as together in bundles.
*   To provide an incentive to purchase, bundles are generally priced lower than the sum of the individual product prices

13\. Next-Best Alternatives

*   product margins are generally lower in markets with many substitutes

**Selling Techniques**

Techniques used to sell can determine a customer’s valuation.

14\. Negotiation

*   a customer’s response to casual questions can reveal his/her willingness to pay

15\. Two-Part Razor/Razor-blade pricing

*   can be appropriate for products that require an initial purchase of a base product (razor) as well as additional variable product purchases (razor blades) that correlate with how much a customer uses and values a product

16\. Dynamic Pricing

*   helps sellers set the right value-based price in unique market environments through using software that adjusts price according to demand.

## Pricing Blossom Strategy

Value-based price serves as foundation from which three strategy stems buds out. Each stem contains several petals that represent the variety of tactics associated with a strategy.

**Steps:**

1.  Set a value-based “starting” price
2.  Offer pick-a-plan strategy alternatives
3.  Create good, better and best versions
4.  Modify product to meet customer needs
5.  Use differential pricing to provide a range of prices
6.  Set prices for the tactics in each pricing blossom strategy
7.  Conduct a cannibalization check

**Cannibalization Check**

Ensure that each tactic in a pricing blossom strategy grows a company’s overall profits.
