[Businesses](https://strategiccfo.com/problems-when-experiencing-business-growth/) call us for many reasons but here are two very common reasons why we get called…

They are growing and want to strengthen the financial function.

OR

They are in [financial distress](https://strategiccfo.com/financial-distress-costs/) and can’t find a way out.

In this blog, we are going to answer all those questions and advise you how to strengthen your [banking relationship](https://strategiccfo.com/managing-banking-relationship-growing-market/) (something _all_ businesses need to do).

## Is Your Business Bankable?

Before we answer the question “is your [business](https://strategiccfo.com/how-hr-impacts-your-business/) bankable?”, what does bankable even mean?

Bankable is a [financial jargon](https://strategiccfo.com/financial-jargon/) that indicates that a [business](https://strategiccfo.com/problems-when-experiencing-business-growth/) is sufficiently healthy to receive interest from [lenders](https://strategiccfo.com/what-lenders-look-at/) to [loan](https://strategiccfo.com/bank-lending-cycle-part-2/). It’s a basic [indicator](https://strategiccfo.com/hooter-meter-main-streets-economic-indicator/) of a company’s success. If a bank is willing to [loan](https://strategiccfo.com/bank-lending-cycle-part-2/) a business [cash](https://strategiccfo.com/what-is-cash-flow/) and/or support a [business](https://strategiccfo.com/does-your-business-need-a-financial-audit/), then the risk of it failing or not paying is low. A bankable company has significant [assets](https://strategiccfo.com/protecting-brand-reputation/), [profits](https://strategiccfo.com/realizing-profit-potential/), liquidity ([cash](https://strategiccfo.com/free-cash-flow-definition/)), and [collateral](https://strategiccfo.com/pledged-collateral/).

An article from [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/larrymyler/2014/09/12/are-you-bankable-heres-why-it-matters/#4b3a497656ae) says it like this, “The bank is your cheapest, but often most difficult, source of [capital](https://strategiccfo.com/roce/) with which to operate and [grow your company](https://strategiccfo.com/pitfalls-avoid-growing-business/).”

So, is your [business](https://strategiccfo.com/status-quo-in-business-movement/) bankable? There are several things to consider.

Financial health will be the primary focus of determining if your [business](https://strategiccfo.com/business-accelerator/) is bankable. There are other things, such as collateral and the character of the person, behind the [loan](https://strategiccfo.com/interest-rate-in-selecting-loan/).

### Financial Things to Look for

Financial things to look for:

*   Are you [cash flow](https://strategiccfo.com/free-cash-flow-definition/) positive and can you [service the debt](https://strategiccfo.com/debt-service-coverage-ratio/)?
*   Do you have positive net [working capital](https://strategiccfo.com/working-capital/)?
*   Does your company have [collateral](https://strategiccfo.com/collateralized-debt-obligations/)?
*   Do you have audited [financial statements](https://strategiccfo.com/pro-forma-financial-statements/)?

### Non-Financial Things to Look for

Non-financial things to look for include the following:

*   Do you have a strong [management](https://strategiccfo.com/management-definition/) team?
*   What does your industry or [segment](https://strategiccfo.com/segment-margin/) look like (strong, declining, etc.)?
*   Do you have a [business plan](https://strategiccfo.com/business-plan/)?
*   The character of the people behind the company and signing the [loan documents](https://strategiccfo.com/documents-in-a-loan-package/)
*   Will you provide a personal or corporate guarantee?

If you are unsure, then just ask your [banker](https://strategiccfo.com/what-your-banker-wants-you-to-know/).

The Need to be Bankable

We deal with [companies](https://strategiccfo.com/mistakes-manufacturing-companies-make/) that are both highly successful or maybe in a distress situation. If you are successful, then you may want to acquire another company, have a distribution, or invest in [CAPEX](https://strategiccfo.com/capital-expenditures/). In today’s market of relatively cheap access to [capital](https://strategiccfo.com/return-on-invested-capital-roic-2/), why would you use your own cash? If you are growing, then you really need to consider a line of credit to help you grow. We see very successful [companies](https://strategiccfo.com/that-squirrel-will-kill-you/) in a high [growth](https://strategiccfo.com/problems-when-experiencing-business-growth/) scenario bleed out of cash and [working capital](https://strategiccfo.com/working-capital-analysis-2/). In those cases, a [line of credit](https://strategiccfo.com/line-of-credit-bank-line/) would make life so much easier.

## Bankable Business Plan

Now, that you have determined if you are bankable or not bankable, it’s time to put together a bankable [business plan](https://strategiccfo.com/business-plan/). There are several things that banks (and [investors](https://strategiccfo.com/3-myths-private-equity-investors/)) want to see before they invest in your and your company. There are ten sections to a bankable business plan.

(HINT: If you do not have a good [banking relationship](https://strategiccfo.com/manage-your-banking-relationship/) with your [banker](https://strategiccfo.com/debt-compliance-101-keep-your-banker-happy/), then even the most perfect [business](https://strategiccfo.com/business-advisory-system/) plan will not guarantee you will get the [capital](https://strategiccfo.com/why-venture-capital/) or line of credit you need/want.)

### Value Definition

What ares in your business create [value](https://strategiccfo.com/book-value-of-equity-per-share-bvps/)? In a bankable business plan, you need to define your value-generating [centers](https://strategiccfo.com/profit-center/) (core-business activities). A successful business will continue to come back to the value that they provide to [customers](https://strategiccfo.com/identifying-profitable-customers/); however, an unsuccessful business will continue to get distracted by other areas of the business that are not generating any or as much value.

### Needs Assessment

A [Needs Assessment](https://strategiccfo.com/lessons/dream-team-needs-assessment/) identifies the company’s priorities. It also defines what needs to be accomplished and the steps that need to be taken to achieve the goals. This is a great tool to use to identify what you know and don’t know about your business. Use this process to analyze every part of your business. Score.org provides a [Needs Assessment](https://s3.amazonaws.com/support.training.videos/CORE+To+WWW+Redirect+Materials/Simple+Steps+Grow+Web+Assessment.pdf) that will gage how well you know your business and your needs.

### Differentiation and Competitive Assessment

[Porter’s Five Forces of Competition](https://strategiccfo.com/porters-five-forces-of-competition/) is used in the differentiation and competitive assessment to identify competing [products](https://strategiccfo.com/increasing-pricing-on-products/)/services _and_ to start the process of differentiating yourself from the competitors. For example, there are 3 companies in Houston that provide the exact same product; however, ABC Co. is working to be bankable. So ABC Co. works to position their product differently and to provide more value than their competitors. Without conducting a differentiation and competitive assessment, ABC Co. risks loosing valuable market share.

### Market Analysis

[Bankers](https://strategiccfo.com/what-your-banker-wants-you-to-know/) want to mitigate their risk. Conduct a [market analysis](https://strategiccfo.com/the-butterfly-effect/) to explain exactly that your market is doing. Is it new and expanding? Or is it saturated and declining? This will help explain your company’s [growth](https://strategiccfo.com/improving-profitability-fuel-for-growth/) potential.

### Marketing Planning

Put together a [marketing plan](https://strategiccfo.com/marketing-plan/). Identify how you are going to market your product or service, what your target market is, and how you are going to continue to grow.

### Sales and Promotion Strategy

Now, that you have built out your [marketing](https://strategiccfo.com/marketing-mix-4-ps-of-marketing/) plan, identify your [sales](https://strategiccfo.com/how-to-produce-realistic-sales-projections/) and promotion [strategy](https://strategiccfo.com/planning-your-exit-strategy/). For example, if a $1 trial for a [subscription](https://strategiccfo.com/subscription-rights-preemptive-rights/) is critical to your [sales](https://strategiccfo.com/its-all-about-profitable-sales/) [strategy](https://strategiccfo.com/need-a-new-pricing-strategy/), then write that out and explain how it has contributed to your company’s [growth](https://strategiccfo.com/problems-when-experiencing-business-growth/).

### Organization Design

What does your [organization](https://strategiccfo.com/how-decision-making-impacts-an-organization/) look like? Are you bombarded with too many non-essential personnel or [administrative](https://strategiccfo.com/administrative-costs/) functions? Or is your company designed to optimize all positions to cover both value-adding functions and administrative functions?

### Financing Needs

Identify your [financing](https://strategiccfo.com/key-elements-when-seeking-financing/) needs. How much do you need to sustain your company? How quickly do you need [financing](https://strategiccfo.com/mezzanine-financing/)? Answer all this questions

### Financial Projections

Next, build out your financial [projections](https://strategiccfo.com/how-to-produce-realistic-sales-projections/). Be sure not to have [optimistic projections](https://strategiccfo.com/optimistic-projections/) that are hard to near impossible to accomplish. They need to be realistic, detailed and logical.

### Risk Analysis

Finally, what [risk](https://strategiccfo.com/risk-taking-the-emergence-of-the-new-cfo/) does your company have? For example, a company who relies heavily on the oil and gas industry needs to identify what [risk](https://strategiccfo.com/transfer-risk/) they will face if that industry declines.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, being bankable is a measurement of success. As previously stated, there are several things you need to watch to remain bankable and [profitable](https://strategiccfo.com/keys-to-profitable-growth/). Measure and track those KPIs.
