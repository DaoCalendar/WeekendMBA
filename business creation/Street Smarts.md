## **Overview: How to do well in business**

When making decisions, do not rely solely on emotion, much less without proper consideration. Take a moment to analyze all factors so that you can achieve your goals more easily.

Also, it is critical that you find out what motivates you, what really matters to you. Tell us: what is your real goal?

You must set concrete goals. To do this, understand the reality you live in if you have enough money to start your business and stay for a while.

Cash flow is also of utmost importance. Think about your pocket before setting up your strategy. This requires knowing the difference between selling and gross profit, trying to keep your profit as high as possible.

Pay attention to the numbers, they will show the viability of your business. Ideally, it should support itself without relying on external sources of capital. After all, the business is alive and, as such, undergoes changes and must be able to adapt.

## **Overview: The right attitude**

To have the right attitude, you need to know one important keyword: resilience. Many problems are inevitable, but some are not. This requires that you maintain close contact with your customers to notice any situation and have time to act on obstacles.

Learn from your own mistakes, understand your share of the blame and not outsource it. Take in every lesson a failure can teach you so as not to repeat it in the future.

A good opportunity is worth more than several advantageous ones. For this, always be willing and focused to seek as much knowledge as you can, analyze and thus achieve the best result.

But understand this: you will not always find the ideal solution for the first moment. It is often improved over time.

So, don't lose your motivation! That's what makes you move on, face all the problems, believing in the final result.

## **Overview: Why startups fail**

Introducing something new is often costly and takes a long time to make a return. But it goes for us: it is the innovative ideas that bring us the most advantage.

A start-up entrepreneur's chances of success are greater when starting his business from scratch than buying an existing one. You don't know the key aspects of business if you weren't there to learn them from the beginning.

Therefore, studying the competition is always good, because this way we know which products or services have already been launched or known.

Your first business plan doesn't have to be overly elaborate. Make it simplified so that all important information about your business is clear to yourself. Detail the operation of each process, its values, concepts and possible failures.

And use your time wisely, it is very precious. Review and rethink strategies, be flexible to adapt them and not waste time.

## **Overview: Onde está o dinheiro**

If you think about asking someone for money, you better make your proposal attractive. Invest in interested investors. You can ask for advice from those who have already got a loan too, for example.

Create a good financial relationship with banks, they are usually a better option than factorings. One factor that facilitates the grant is good credit history.

But beware: some common mistakes undermine your relationship with the bank. Talk to your manager a lot, be aware of rules and deadlines. Also, do not argue when you are aware that you are wrong, let alone use money that is not effectively available to you. You can accumulate debt this way.

Money derived from sales of products and services is like a loan. Learn how to better select your buyers and win good customers.

## **Overview: Magic numbers**

Some numbers may act as a real-time index type. So if something is not going well, you can think of a solution without having to wait for the monthly report.

Make your monthly sales tracking manually in detail. Separate into categories to make it easy to evaluate every aspect of your business and understand the relationship between them. This will undoubtedly give you greater control over your cash flow.

Contrary to popular belief, more sales reflect less cash flow. Thus, it is critical that you make calculations and predictions of how much capital will be needed so that you do not miss it in the future.

Some data help you with this calculation, such as:

*   the volume of product/service and the time to deliver it;
*   your gross margin;
*   How much it costs to make or deliver each product/service;
*   How often you receive payment from your customers.

Many entrepreneurs overestimate or underestimate their business, so it is more than necessary that you know the REAL value of your business.

## **Overview: The art of negotiating**

Anyone inside knows that negotiation is an art and you should conduct it with mastery. Try to be flexible, listen to proposals, analyze them so as not to lose good opportunities. After all, listening is as important as speaking.

Know that each negotiation and each client requires different strategies. Draw on your experience and instincts to see beyond. Try to see "out of the box", finding possible advantages and disadvantages that are not evident.

What many do not know is that most negotiation does not consist of verbal language. Realize what is not said, analyze the facial expressions of the person you are dealing with.

The secret is in the details. This way, you may reach an agreement that is beneficial to both sides.

## **Overview: It all starts with a sale**

You may wonder what things will look like when you start your business, but you will only find out effectively once it is working. Only then will you know who your real customers are and which product is the strongest.

From there you will have to look for your differential to be more successful and escape the losses.

It is in practice that you find out what is most profitable, what your niche is. Because business is a living thing, these results are not fixed and may change over time. So, once again, be flexible and understand market changes.

Do not be afraid to receive a negative answer. As the father of one of the authors said, "If you don't ask, you won't make it." Each “no” you receive is an opportunity for you to rethink your strategy and refine it.

What's more, your relationship with your competitors also says a lot about you. Your image is very valuable. Therefore, do not speak ill of your competitors.

Sometimes things will not go the way you expected. So know how to lose, be helpful and polite to earn respect, even at not so favorable times.

## **Overview: Good sales, bad sales and those that escape**

Each sale is unique! Some are better than others and a considerable factor is a gross profit and not the size of the sale. Understand that considering the security of your business, multiple small or medium sales are better than few large sales.

But of course, selling is often not easy. And the secret is in showing your differential. Tell the customer what they lose if they don't buy your project, and what they get by buying it. Let them try what you offer.

And most importantly: listen to your customer! Few sellers hear what they have to say, what they are looking for, or how they want a particular product. Always be willing to offer the most appropriate solution for your customers.

"Bargains" will appear, whether you like them or not, and the authors recommend that you be careful! By reducing the price considerably, you lose out on gross profit.

Selling cheaper may affect the quality or affect business. When making promotions and discounts, consider how long and the conditions that will be offered.

## **Overview: Customers Forever**

Selling is important, but building a solid relationship with your customers is paramount. They are an important factor for the growth and success of your business. Treat them well not only during the sale but before and after as well.

Their loyalty can be a lifelong benefit to your business. The tip of the authors is precisely to make life easier for their clients. Show you the best payment options, products, and how to make the most of your new purchase.

Showing concern for their satisfaction gives you loyal customers. And these are as important as future customers. Treat them with the same care and attention, keep in touch, make sure they feel valued.

## **Overview: How to lose customers**

Price increases are almost always inevitable over time and directly influence your relationship as a customer. Try to increase gradually and subtly instead of having a large increase in value. Big increases cause big impacts.

Don't make your customer think he pays dearly on a product just to keep his standard of living high. When charging a higher price, have a compelling argument that justifies why higher values.

But also think: often the price is associated with quality. Therefore, if you keep prices too low, this may reflect your reputation. Take care of your image and your profits.

Lastly, beware of the rules you create about how your salespeople should proceed. Poor service may be linked to the way your employee was instructed. Know your customers, recognize that each case is a case.

## **Overview: The decision to grow**

A business plan is important but no more important than your life plan. Your personal life directly influences the decisions you make to conduct your business. Know where you want to go and how you want to realize your plans.

It's natural to want your business to grow, who doesn't, right? But understand that failure is much more easily mapped than success. Something that worked at one time may not work at another. So don't think you already have the triumph formula and plan your steps well based on current analysis.

## **Overview: Becoming boss**

When we idealize the position of leadership, we end up abstracting the responsibilities attached to it. Decision making should be best for the company. To keep your judgment from being shaken, keep your relationship with your employees as professional as possible.

Note that you will not have to play the role of administrator forever. You can, for example, find someone who does the job as well as or even better than you to replace you. That way you can focus on what you really like.

Have someone you trust work with you. And if an employee tries to outwit you, don't spread your distrust on others. Look for ways to improve procedures to prevent and hinder this type of action. After all, there are few employees within a company who have such malice to try to magnify themselves.

## **Overview: The only thing you can't delegate**

The people who work for you are key in your quest for success. You can determine who are the best employees overtime, and the company culture helps filter them out and create better and more loyal employees.

Creating or recognizing a culture is as important as focusing on it, as it reflects the company's entire way of acting. If you are 100% flexible, “subcultures” will start to emerge.

This ends up creating divergences in decision making and attitudes. So have a well-established **corporate culture** and encourage your employees to follow the tradition.

Smart choices made about capital employment are crucial and will make your business successful or not. As expenses tend to rise, it is critical that you have a good team to decide on financial issues.

Keep in close contact with your employees, expose their expectations about spending money and how it should be employed. Explain that unnecessary or excessive spending gets in the way of the company.

## **Overview: Winning is a team sport**

Selling is a collective job and you have to choose wisely who makes up this team. Not always the best resume represents the best employee. Some salespeople, in seeking the best results for themselves, end up creating their own rules for achieving them.

Brodsky and Burlingham warn: Commissions are not a good stimulus option. They can lead to unhealthy competitiveness that will gradually segregate the team.

Since selling is teamwork, each has its role, acting directly or indirectly. If an industry is not doing well, it may reflect the image of the company as a whole.

For example, if the complaints industry doesn't serve the customer well, they are unlikely to want to buy back from your company. Therefore, pay attention to the progress of each sector to attack directly at the weak point.

## **Overview: Help! I need someone**

Problems are inevitable, and the way you deal with them is critical. Sometimes we can't see a way out of a problem, and that's when we need a second person.

An outside opinion can help you see it from another perspective and understand what the real problem is. Even by being counseled, we can find an even better way to solve such a hindrance. But you have to know who to order them for.

Each person, each professional has his or her strengths. And you might ask someone for help who has no idea what you're going through or how you can get you out of it. Even more: you may bump into bad people, which is worse.

## **Overview: When the student is ready, the teacher appears**

No matter how experienced you are, there is always something new to learn. Although not always clear, there are always lessons to be learned behind advice, experiences, and challenges.

When a problem recurs, we must solve its consequences, but the most important thing is to understand its cause so that it does not recur. Palliative solutions do not prevent errors from recurring in the future. It is necessary to prevent.

Always be able to deal with the “stones in your path”. The more prepared you are, the greater your advantage and the less chance of being caught off guard. Know every aspect of your business and don't be afraid to check out some information if you don't remember or are unsure.

Important: Do not make important decisions in the heat of the moment or under pressure. Ponder calmly and decide clearly to avoid mistakes.

## **Overview: Holding the stones**

To learn about your salesperson's development, depending on what type of business you have, wait for a sales cycle. Teach it as much as you can so that when you receive the results, you know if it has a return that outweighs your investment in it.

Clear employee learning about your business is essential. This is because, by understanding how your business works, salespeople tend to improve their commitment and increase sales. Sometimes they may even find better ways to close new deals and win new customers.

Finally, be the biggest enthusiast of your company, believe it to be the most amazing. Your enthusiasm and passion are the biggest factors that will help you overcome any obstacles that arise.

## **What other authors say about it?**

In the book “Selling When No One Is Buying,” author Dave Lakhani advises: If you are not selling, try to improve your approach. In tough times, bad salespeople give up and open opportunities for the most creative and efficient salespeople.

For Marcus Buckingham and Donald Clifton, authors of “Now, Discover Your Strengths,” to increase company productivity, the key is to focus on employees' strengths rather than trying to improve their weaknesses.

Finally, in the book by Brazilian businessman Flávio Augusto, “Value Generation”, he shows how instead of just working for capital, it is important to create value for customers. By generating value in other people's lives, in return, they will create value for you.
