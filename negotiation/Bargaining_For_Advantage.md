# Bargaining for Advantage by G. Richard Shell

*   Prepare thoroughly in advance
*   Locate the decision maker
*   Built rapport
*   Discover the other party’s goals – ask questions, obtain information on interests, issues and perceptions. Test for understanding, summarise, probe first then disclose, signal regarding your leverage
*   If you open then you benefit from setting the anchor point.
*   Look for common ground
*   On what issues might the other side say “no”?
*   Search for low-cost options that solve the other party’s problems while advancing your goals
*   Trade issues

*   Leverage
    *   Flows to those with the greatest control and comfort with the present situations.
    *   Threats must be credible.
    *   For whom is time a factor?
    *   Create momentum by giving little things.
    *   Create a vision that the other side has something to lose from no deal
    *   Positive leverage: Is having something the other guy wants, or better, needs, or best, cannot do without
    *   Negative Leverage: Threat based, with hints rather than shouts
    *   Normative Leverage: Give and take
    *   Leverage changes constantly through the negotiation
    *   Leverage depends on the other party’s perceptions of the situation, not the facts
*   Closing Technique: Scarcity Effect
    *   Competition (many others are interested)
    *   Deadlines (we will withdraw the offer soon)
    *   Walkouts (I will get up and leave at any time)
*   Closing Technique: Overcommitment
    *   eg standing in line at DisneyLand
    *   Leverage loss aversion  (“We’ve come so far, don’t let all this time and effort go to waste!”)
*   Softer Closing Technique: Split the difference
*   Beware Rogue Tactics:
    *   Lies about bottom lines and alternatives
    *   Low-balling
    *   Phoney issues / decoy / red herring
    *   Fake authority ploys
    *   Overcommitment (drags out the negotiation process and raises or lowers the price or terms at the last minute)
    *   Good guy / bad guy
    *   Consistency traps (The goal of which is to pre-commit you to a seemingly innocent standard. They get you to agree to a statement before telling you why the statement is important)
    *   Reciprocity ploys (“I made a concession, now its your turn”. Beware of reciprocity traps – “Here’s a flower, may I have a donation?”)
    *   The nibble (just before closing hoping your exhausted)
