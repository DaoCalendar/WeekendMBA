## What is Total Leadership?

Total Leadership was created by [Stew Friedman](https://www.totalleadership.org/about/team/stew-friedman/), founding director of the Wharton School’s Leadership Programs and its [Work/Life Integration Project](http://worklife.wharton.upenn.edu/), and former head of [Ford Motor’s Leadership Development Center](https://www.totalleadership.org/resources/articles/#cases). It is a proven method for learning how to achieve four-way wins, wins at work, at home, in your community, and for your private self, by following these principles:

*   **Be Real**, act with authenticity by clarifying what’s important
*   **Be Whole**, act with integrity by respecting the whole person
*   **Be Innovative**, act with creativity by continually experimenting

Our purpose is to help people enact these principles to become better leaders and have richer lives; to produce stronger business results, find clearer purpose, feel less stressed and more connected to people who matter most, contribute further to important causes, and get greater support for generating change.

We deliver engaging, results-driven leadership development and personal growth through [keynotes](https://www.totalleadership.org/services/keynote-speech/),  [workshops](https://www.totalleadership.org/services/workshops/), [coaching](https://www.totalleadership.org/services/pro-coaching/), [assessments](https://www.totalleadership.org/services/assessments/), [consulting](https://www.totalleadership.org/services/consulting/), and [train-the-trainer](https://www.totalleadership.org/services/train-the-trainer/) opportunities . Essential to our success are the real collaboration and meaningful connections that thrive in the coaching communities (online and in person) we organize and cultivate.

## The Total Leadership Difference

Total Leadership is unique because, unlike most approaches to leadership development, which focus on professional skills, it is about performance in all parts of life. And, unlike most work/life and self-help programs, which focus more on family and personal needs than on business results, Total Leadership is about winning in all domains, including work, by creating mutual value among them.

Four-way wins are there for the taking. You have to know how to look for them and then generate the support needed to achieve them. Let us show you.
