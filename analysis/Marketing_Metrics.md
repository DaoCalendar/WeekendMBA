# 19 Important Digital Marketing Metrics for Measuring Success

How are digital marketing metrics effectively measured for success with brand growth? You’re probably thinking: leads and sales.

But a successful marketing campaign can be determined by much more than just those types of conversions!

Ask yourself:

Do you want more organic traffic to your website?

How about a broader reach on social media?

Or, a higher email click-through rate?

These are all valid goals to aim for and are backed by analytics data you can gather over time. As you’ll soon learn, there are a number of important digital marketing metrics to track and guide your campaigns, both for sales conversion and [brand awareness](https://freshsparks.com/successful-brand-building-process/).

How do I measure something so touchy-feely?

[Branding is your strategy](https://freshsparks.com/business-branding/), and who you are. It’s marketing that will execute on that strategy, and how you build awareness for your brand. Especially through digital marketing, these days.

## Measuring Your Digital Marketing Campaigns

Before you can determine if your digital marketing campaign is a success, you need to set objective, [achievable goals](https://www.smartsheet.com/blog/essential-guide-writing-smart-goals).

### Starting With A Goal

Much of your online strategy is born from your goals.

Goal setting ensures you have something to strive for. What’s more, it provides a guideline for the digital marketing metrics you’ll use to measure the success of one or more campaigns.

I’ll put it another way:

**You really can’t measure success without goals!**

That fact holds true no matter what you’re attempting to measure. From digital marketing success to personal financial success, without goals you are limited to two basic analyses:

_“I seem to be making some progress.”_

Or:

_“This doesn’t look like it’s working.”_

Kind of vague, huh?

Take a look at the sample below from [Sprout Social](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/). It shows five distinct social media metrics and a detailed plan for how the company intends to achieve them.

![How to set goals for digital marketing success](https://freshsparks.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/measuring-digital-marketing-success-setting-goals.jpg)

Your digital campaign will have more than just a social media element. However, this template offers a nice overview of how you can set goals for anything—and during any point of your marketing funnel.

**SEE ALSO:** [10 Ways to Set Realistic Social Media Goals for Your Business](https://freshsparks.com/social-media-goals/)

There are a few key details you’ll want to include above and beyond what you see in the diagram.

I’ll break down exactly how to set the goals you can use when measuring digital marketing KPIs:

### Commit to a Time Frame

Accountability is a large, if not the largest, part of reaching a goal. Whether you have 5 days or 5 months, you must include a concrete time frame.

Determining the time frame for your digital marketing campaign goals will help create a sense of urgency as well as accomplishment.

A time frame can also set parameters for comparison when you run marketing metrics reports for month-over-month or year-over-year progress.

### Determine Success Factors

Let’s say your goal is to earn 500,000 impressions from [social media campaigns](https://www.designwizard.com/blog/best-social-media-campaigns/) and drive 10,000 new visitors to the website. Those are two excellent digital marketing success factors.

The key to this step is determining a quantifiable result to achieve—real numbers that could be an educated guess or based on a pattern of growth.

Keeping a time frame in mind, be sure to determine how long you have to reach this milestone. It can be one month or 12 months, depending on the effort behind the digital marketing campaign.

### Provide Specific Details

When you think about digital marketing KPIs, there should be numbers assigned to them.

Simply saying, “expose target audience to brand content” isn’t enough. Set yourself up for success by providing as much detail as possible.

Being specific with details will better prepare you to execute your campaign by serving as a roadmap. Furthermore, it helps you pinpoint what works and what doesn’t when you’re ready to measure efficacy.

### Create a Marketing Measurement Template

Once you have selected the digital marketing metrics for your campaign, putting together a marketing measurement template is easy and provides valuable insight.

This document will serve as a guideline. It is something you can use (and modify as necessary) with each campaign.

A marketing measurement template might include things like:

*   Your initial goal(s).
*   An overview of what happened during the campaign (your marketing metrics will go here).
*   Things that worked the best, and what you learned from them.
*   Things that didn’t work so well, and what you learned from them.

As a refresher, this graphic from [Perdoo](https://www.perdoo.com/blog/okr-vs-smart-goals/) explains concisely how to write SMART goals for any project or campaign:

![Digital Marketing Success SMART Goals](https://freshsparks.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/digital-marketing-success-smart-goals.jpg)

Now you’re prepared to set goals before executing a successful digital marketing campaign for your brand.

Let’s take a look at the exact marketing metrics you will use to measure the success of those goals.

## 19 Digital Marketing Metrics You Need to Track

When it comes to measuring digital marketing success, there are seemingly endless digital marketing metrics. Below is a compilation of the most important ones you’ll need to consider.

Not all of these digital marketing KPIs may be relevant to your particular business goals, but it’s a starting point on the road to finding ROI (return on investment)!

### Website Traffic Metrics That Matter for Growth

These first 10 items outline the website traffic metrics that matter most for success with digital marketing. Do you have [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) installed on your website? You’ll need it, or something similar in order to track this type of data.

### 1\. Overall Website Traffic

What do most companies measure to determine the success of their websites?

Traffic.

Your website serves as your home base, and the face of your brand. Therefore, all of your digital marketing efforts will likely focus on driving traffic there. Individual campaigns may focus on list building or increasing social media reach, but the ultimate goal of that activity is to send more traffic to your website over time.

Because of this, [measuring website traffic](https://www.robbierichards.com/seo/how-much-traffic-website-gets/) metrics regularly will provide you with a number of insights such as which campaigns are working and when.

![Digital Marketing Success Metrics - Website Traffic](https://freshsparks.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/digital-marketing-success-metrics-website-traffic.jpg)

_Source: [Digital Inspiration](https://www.labnol.org/internet/find-website-traffic-hits/8008/)_

If at any point you see a [steady decline in traffic](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2017/05/16/12-common-reasons-your-website-traffic-is-dropping/) while still conducting consistent marketing efforts, consider troubleshooting your website. You may find broken links, a Google Algorithm penalty, or other technical issues deterring visitors.

**Tips for sending more traffic to your website:**

*   Optimize all pages on your site with relevant keywords
*   Consistently publish in-depth [content on your blog](https://freshsparks.com/how-to-build-a-successful-blog/)
*   Promote your content on social media channels
*   Create targeted ads to a landing page with an offer

### 2\. Traffic by Source

This useful website traffic metric sheds light on exactly where your website visitors are coming from.

With the myriad of marketing platforms available and limited time to capitalize on all of them, the Traffic By Source metric is one to watch.

Use it to determine which sources are winners, and which ones need a little more attention. Or, use it to narrow down where you’ll spend your valuable time creating content.

![Digital Marketing Success Metrics - Traffic Source](https://freshsparks.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/digital-marketing-success-metrics-traffic-source.jpg)

Here are the four main website traffic sources tracked by Google Analytics:

*   **Organic Search:** These users clicked a link on a search engine result that brought them to your website.
*   **Direct Visitors:** These users typed your URL directly into the search bar, or perhaps have it bookmarked and returned to visit.
*   **Referrals:** These users were sent to your website when they clicked a link from another website.
*   **Social:** These users came to your website after finding your social media profile or content posts.

### 3\. New Visitors vs. Returning Visitors

The value of this dual metric is that it helps you determine how relevant your website content is over time. Multiple visits can indicate you are providing information that people find so valuable, that they keep coming back.

As you release new content on a regular basis (think: blogs), you can review your New vs. Returning Visitors marketing metric to see how any given content piece is performing.

![Digital Marketing Success Metrics - New Visitors vs. Returning Visitors](https://freshsparks.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/digital-marketing-metrics-new-vs-returning-visitors.jpg)

_Source: [whatagraph.com](https://whatagraph.com/blog/articles/key-google-analytics-metrics-to-track-your-seo-success)_

Simply put:

If you’re looking to drive more organic traffic to your website, New Visitors may be of importance to you.

If you would like to measure how many people come back to browse and consume info, the Returning Visitors website traffic metric is important to note.

**Tips for increasing new and returning visitors:**

*   Create and publish valuable blog content that can be found organically via search engines
*   Use Twitter to promote blog posts, and add 1-2 relevant hashtags
*   Send an email blast to your subscribers after a new piece of content is published

*   [How to Attract Visitors to Your Site](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/80220)

### 4\. Sessions

Sessions refer to the number of visits your website receives. Google specifically counts this in 30-minute increments, meaning it triggers this website traffic metric only once every half hour for each individual user.

Think of [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2XEixYw), as an example:

Users may trigger a session in the morning to shop, and then visit again later in the day to add something new to their cart. Each of those are considered unique sessions.

### 5\. Average Session Duration

Depending on your website’s function (informational, ecommerce, etc.) or the industry, the time on site metric can vary in its relevance to your campaigns.

A study by [Brafton](https://www.brafton.com/blog/strategy/brafton-2017-content-marketing-benchmark-report/) found these average session duration numbers by industry.

![Digital Marketing Success Metrics - Average Session Duration](https://freshsparks.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/digital-marketing-success-metrics-average-session-duration.jpg)

Average Session Duration is a general indicator of how long visitors spend on your site entirely. This helps you to understand how your site performs from a user experience (UX) standpoint.

*   Is your website easy to navigate?
*   Are users finding what they’re looking for quickly?
*   Is the content valuable and worth reviewing at length?

Average Session Duration (time on site) can help answer these questions and many more.

**Tips for increasing a visitor’s time on page:**

*   Add a video to your content
*   Use [Bucket Brigades](https://backlinko.com/seo-copywriting) to help readers stay engaged
*   Increase the readability of your copy (larger fonts, more white space)

*   [11 Hacks to Increase Visitors’ Average Time Spent on Site](https://optinmonster.com/11-hacks-to-keep-visitors-on-your-pages-longer/)

### 6\. Page Views

This is the total number of pages viewed. A user who repeatedly visits the same page will trigger this marketing metric, so it’s the broadest of all page-related measurements for digital marketing success.

However, it’s one of the most important website traffic metrics.

It’s relevant to know how many pages are visited on your website in a given time period. This helps you to understand if your entire site is of value or if only certain pages are.

### 7\. Most Visited Pages

To further determine which areas of your website are most valuable, look at this metric. You can find it in the “Behaviors” section of Google Analytics.

The Most Visited Pages metric uncovers all sorts of information about exactly where your site’s visitors are going and for how long. For a deeper analysis, check out the Behavior Flow.

![Measuring Digital Marketing Success - Behavior Flow](https://freshsparks.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/measuring-digital-marketing-success-behavior.jpg)

_Source: [Roadside](https://www.roadsidedentalmarketing.com/blog/google-analytics-behavior-flow/)_

### 8\. Exit Rate

Here’s a marketing metric that is very specific and reveals quite a bit about your website design and user experience.

If your campaign is meant to drive new users to your website for a more general “learn more” branding effort, the Exit Rate metric will show you exactly where they left after they reviewed your content.

Unlike Bounce Rate which triggers when someone views only one page, Exit Rate tells you where the user lost interest after spending some time exploring.

Make sure they don’t lose interest in your brand!

![Digital Marketing Metrics Guide](https://freshsparks.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/digital-marketing-metrics-blog-thumb.jpg)

### 9\. Bounce Rate

Different from Exit Rate, the Bounce Rate metric is the percentage of people who leave (bounce away) from your website after viewing only one page.

This metric can help reveal that visitors may be leaving because:

*   The site takes too long to load
*   They did not immediately find what they were looking for
*   They found relevant content but were not compelled to click further
*   An error page loaded

Unless your website is set up to send users to a separate URL for conversion, you should look to the Bounce Rate number to determine if your campaign is effective.

An overview of average bounce rates for certain environments is noted below, in a chart by [Kissmetrics](https://neilpatel.com/blog/bounce-rate/).

![Measuring Digital Marketing Success - Bounce Rate](https://freshsparks.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/digital-marketing-success-metrics-bounce-rate-1.jpg)

_Source: [CrazyEgg](https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/why-users-leave-a-website/)_

If you are marketing a new product but your link sends users to the website’s Home page, you’re likely to have a high bounce rate. Therefore, combat this by sending them to a page that is highly relevant to the path you want them on.

**Tips for reducing** **bounce rate on your website:**

*   Decrease your page load time
*   Add internal links to your page copy
*   Include images or other visuals in your content
*   Use a compelling call-to-action

*   [11 Easy Ways to Reduce Your Bounce Rate](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/07/reduce-bounce-rate)

### 10\. Conversion Rate

Google Analytics can help measure the number of conversions made on your site.

However, conversions may mean different things depending on the campaign.

For example, they could be:

*   an actual sale,
*   a subscriber,
*   a completed download,
*   a lead entry,
*   and more.

Oftentimes, the number crunchers only look to this digital marketing metric to determine if your campaign is effective. However, it’s only one piece of the puzzle and should be part of your overall digital marketing strategy.

Guess what: there are even more digital marketing metrics you need to measure!

Below, take a look at some others related to your online strategy such as:

*   Social media metrics
*   Advertising metrics
*   Email marketing metrics

## Other Digital Marketing Metrics That Matter

### 11\. Impressions

Which marketing metric is especially important to clients who are running a branding campaign?

Impressions!

Sometimes confused with reach, an impression is the larger overall number of views your content or advertisement receives.

Your content on social media or a pay-per-click ad may be shown multiple times to the same person. Each time is counted as an individual impression. As a result, this number will always be higher than reach because the reach metric is only triggered once per user.

### 12\. Social Reach

The posts you make on your social media platforms are meant to reach a wide number of users. This social media metric tells you exactly how many people were reached (i.e. saw your content).

Now, the number of people reached is always much larger than the number who engage.

A benchmark goal is to see 2-5% engagement based on your overall reach.

**Tips to increase your social media reach:**

*   Fully brand all your social media profiles
*   Post curated and original content consistently
*   Engage with your community

**More resources to help improve social reach:**

*   [How to Get More Followers, Fans and Likes](https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/27094/8-guaranteed-ways-to-increase-social-media-reach.aspx)

### 13\. Social Engagement

Social Engagement reflects the total number of interactions made on any given social media post.

This could mean:

*   Clicks
*   Shares
*   Likes
*   Retweets
*   Comments

Engagement is the yardstick by which to measure all of your [social media success](https://freshsparks.com/social-media-best-practices-for-business/).

You can pay for all the others, but engagement is only earned when a user chooses to interact with your content. Because of this, you can easily rank your content types based on how much engagement they receive. This helps to guide your future content creation!

### 14\. Email Open Rate

If you’re list building with your website (and you should be), this is one of the most important email marketing metrics you need to watch.

Your Email Open Rate measures the number of people who open your email campaign as compared to the overall number of those who received it.

High open rates indicate:

*   Properly segmented list
*   Attractive subject line
*   Appropriate send time

Low open rates tell you at least one (if not all) of those factors above are lacking.

*   [Email Open Rates: A Scientific, Step by Step Guide](https://www.superoffice.com/blog/email-open-rates/)

### 15\. Click-Through Rate

The Click-through Rate (CTR) can be used as an email marketing metric as well as a paid advertising metric. Clicks on email blasts are often some of the highest conversion-drivers across the board.

Your CTR as it relates to pay-per-click helps to determine your relevance score and affects your Cost Per Click.

**Resources to help you improve click-through rate:**

*   [5 Psychology-Backed Ways to Improve Your Email Click-Through Rate](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/2019/06/improve-email-click-through-rate-psychology/)

### 16\. Cost Per Click

Cost Per Click (CPC) applies to both pay-per-click marketing and a number of social media platforms that offer the clicks-to-site ad type.

These online advertising metrics reflect the amount you pay for each individual click a user performs. This is relevant as it directly relates to your overall marketing budget in this area. Your budget can only go so far; the lower your CPC, that farther it goes.

### 17\. Cost Per Conversion

Cost Per Conversion relates completely to your individual business model, and often to your individual online marketing campaign. As I mentioned previously, not every metric matters to every campaign. This might be one to leave off if you aren’t converting sales directly online.

However, if you’re running an [ecommerce website](https://freshsparks.com/ecommerce-user-experience-best-practices/) where users can add something to a cart and convert there, CPC is a must-track metric. Simply put, these digital marketing analytics tell you how much it costs to convert a site visitor into a sale.

### 18\. Cost Per Acquisition

Your Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) is only relevant when you have returning customers. This doesn’t just apply to subscription-based businesses or even ecommerce sites. Consider how a private golf community calculates CPA knowing that their members pay monthly dues.

Understanding the lifetime value of a customer helps you back into the proper amount you should spend to acquire a new one.

### 19\. Overall ROI

The return on investment marketing metric should come as no surprise as it serves as a true baseline for success. Basically, ROI equates to how much you spent (investment) vs. how much you earned (return).

![19 Important Metrics for Measuring Digital Marketing Success - Overall ROI](https://freshsparks.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/measuring-digital-marketing-success-overall-roi.jpg)

_Source: [Corporate Finance Institute](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/return-on-investment-roi-formula/)_

It’s easy to lose track of exactly what you’re spending on marketing because we often fail to count hours of effort. Ensuring you properly calculate your online marketing campaign’s ROI will be the key to determining if it was an overall success or not.
