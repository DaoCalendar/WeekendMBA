*   To win with premium prices, clobber competitors with service
*   Call every customer after the job is completed to verify satisfaction
*   Offer strong guarantees
*   Get crazy publicity & word of mouth with free product to local companies (works if you own a cafe anyway)
*   Stake out a market leader position from the start – define a new niche
*   Break even on the first sale / product to get a mailing list together. Sell to that group long term
*   Repackage the same core product / service in heaps of different ways, different formats, different prices, to different target markets
